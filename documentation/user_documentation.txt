Using The Application:
---------------------

If you are an end user:
-----------------------
1. Run the server with the ./run.sh file
2. Once the server is running, open a browser and navigate to <servername>:5000
	- Most likely this is localhost:5000, but also could be testium.cs.uoregon.edu:5000 for example
3. Input your chosen gpx file
4. Wait for the program to compute the directions based on the gpx file chosen

Module Interface
-----------------
The interface for the web app is extremely simple.
The opening page mirrors this overall simplicity. There is only one place to input a file, and once you have selected your prefered gpx
file, simply hit submit. The file will then be processed while a loading icon is shown, and your directions will eventually pop up.
