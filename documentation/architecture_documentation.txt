Architecture:
------------
The only file that exists outside of the src directory is our docker-compose.yml, which is the top-level of our
project. This file is responsible for running and hosting the server on a specific port (5000), and running the 
Dockerfile, which takes care of dependencies, requirements and runs the flask server through app.py.

All of our source files otherwise, exist within the src directory of the project. The main file that does the backend work
is the flask python file named app.py. app.py imports functions from the other python files, and runs them within the flask 
functions so it can eventually serve the output to the user in the browser. These other files include **( !--- include files 
and functionality here ---! )**. app.py also serves the html files in the sub-directory templates.

We have seperated the flask file and the files that calculate the turns for ease of building something from the independent parts.
Our turn calculation files are already completely independent, and simply take any arbitrary gpx file to work. app.py and its subsequent
html templates act as a good starting point for a project that needs to take file input from the user. Simply replacing the currently 
imported functions with other developed functions can seamlessly create a project with an entirely new functionality. This seperation 
of files makes it easy for further development, as shown here.
