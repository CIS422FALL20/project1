This project has not been tested on other docker versions, as we recommend updating docker to its most recent version.

Our only dependency is that your machine can install and run docker on any of the following operating systems:


Getting Started:
---------------

For Installing Docker, if requirement is not already satisfied:
---------------------------------------------------------------

*For macOS version 10.14 or newer*
You can download docker with the following command:
$ brew cask install docker

or you can follow the instructions at https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

*For Linux*
Depending on your Linux Distribution, you can follow the instructions at the follow locations:

CentOS: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/
Debian: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
Fedora: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/
Raspbian: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

*For Windows 10*
You can follow the instructions at
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/


-- You can test if docker is installed by running --

$ docker -v

-- If this returns a version of docker, you have correctly installed docker -- 

After Docker is installed:
--------------------------
Clone the project from our GitHub Repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/CIS422FALL20/project1

--> Get an api key from https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/key/a8288a33-a249-4a99-8b26-5a8ac05126f7?project=endless-apogee-269606
--> Open the credentials.ini file within the src directory, and enter in your api key


Build the Project:
------------------
You can do this with our run.sh file after setting its permissions, by running the following commands in the command line

$ chmod 777 run.sh
$ cd project1
$ ./run.sh

The run.sh file contains the following command

$ docker-compose up --build

This will build our project, and run the webserver, which you can view in localhost:5000 in a browser
