**Overview**
This project is a simple Web App that takes gpx data as an input and returns a list of directions,
otherise known as a cue sheet, based on that data. The data typically comes from a road biker, however
it is compatible with any street, so the data will work if a hiker, car or pedestrian of any kind sticks
to the main roads.

This project is compatible with any machine that is running Docker version 19.03.8 (the most recent version), and docker-compose version 1.25.0.
If you install Docker Desktop on Windows or MacOS, docker-compose is included as a package.
